                <h4>How to Style a Quiff</h4>
                <p>
                    To style a quiff, begin with clean hair and select the appropriate styling products such as pomade
                    or wax. After washing and towel-drying your hair, apply the chosen product evenly throughout.
                    Utilize a blow dryer to shape the quiff, directing the front section of your hair upwards and
                    slightly back for volume and height. Keep the sides neat and tidy using a comb or your fingers. Once
                    styled, finish with a light mist of hairspray to set the quiff in place. Remember, practice makes
                    perfect, so don't hesitate to experiment with different techniques until you achieve the desired
                    look that complements your individual style.</p>
